  Meme   Status  Confirmed  Type: Advice Animal  Badges:  NSFW  Year 2007  Origin  Flickr  Tags kids, exploitable, baby, success kid, success, advice animal, sandcastles, roflcon iii, victory baby Build Your Own 


About
Success Kid, sometimes known as I Hate Sandcastles, is a reaction image of a baby at a beach with a smug facial expression. It has been used in image macros to designate either success or frustration. In early 2011, the original image was turned into an advice animal style image macro with captions describing a situation that goes better than expected.
Origin
The original image was taken by photographer Laney Griner of her then 11-month-old son Sammy on August 26th, 2007. She posted it to both her personal Flickr account[1] and put it up on Getty Images[6], which has since been removed.


Spread
As early as January 2008, users on social networking sites like MySpace[3] began incorporating the photo of Sammy into their profiles, either as their avatar or as part of the page’s layout. It was often paired with the phrases “Ima Fuck you up” or “I Hate Sandcastles”


In May 2008, the image was made freely available on image hosting site Pyzam.com[4] with a second child photoshopped in to the background. It was reposted on humor sites Damn Funny Pictures[8] and Daily Haha[9] the next month. This version was part of a photoshop thread on Russian-language social news site Yaplakal.com[5] on June 4th of that same year.
Advice Animal
One of the earliest Success Kid advice animal style image macros was uploaded to Reddit on January 28th, 2011.[10] As of February 2011, there are over 66,000 instances of Success Kid on Quickmeme[11], nearly 300 on MemeGenerator[12], and over 3000 results on the Advice Animals subreddit.[13]



In July 2011, the single topic Tumblr Fuck Yeah Success Kid[14] was started and collections of these images were posted to humor sites Pleated Jeans[15] in July 2011 and Uproxx[16] that November. There is also a category for Success Kid images on Ranker[17] and Memebase[18] and a Facebook[19] fan page with over 4000 likes.
Kidney Transplant Crowdfunding Campaign
On April 8th, 2015, Griner launched a crowdfunding page on GoFundMe[25] to raise money for her husband Justin’s kidney transplant (shown below).



On April 13th, The Daily Dot[32] published an article about the crowdfunding effort, which included an email from Griner in which she revealed her husband “spends 12 hours a week in a dialysis clinic.” On April 15th, Redditor IrishProf submitted an article about Griner’s campaign page to the /r/UpliftingNews[25] subreddit, where it gathered more than 3,900 votes (85% upvoted) in the the first 24 hours. In the coming days, many news sites published articles about the GoFundMe campaign, including Time,[27] E! Online,[28] Today,[29] IB Times[30] and Metro.[31] Within one week, the page reached over $88,000 of its $75,000 goal.
Notable Examples





Success Kid in Advertising
In February 2012, British media company Virgin Media recently began running billboards featuring a mirrored version of Sammy’s photo. The advertising campaign was covered by New Rising Media[20] and the Daily What.[21]



Griner later confirmed via Flickr that she did get paid for use of the photo and he would also be appearing in Vitamin Water commercials in the United States in 2012.
Other Pictures
Laney Griner has continued to post photos of Sammy on her Flickr[7] through the years. Many have been shared on Reddit[22], Blame it on The Voices[23] and the Daily What.[24]
