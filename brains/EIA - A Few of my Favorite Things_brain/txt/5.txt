  Meme   Status  Submission  Year 2003  Origin  Erik Wernquist  Tags frog, crazy About
The Annoying Thing, mostly known as Crazy Frog, is a 3D animated character also known in a commercial for a ringtone of Jamba!.
Origin
In 1997, the swedish student “Daniel Malmedahl” tried to imitate some engine noises. After he posted this on an unknown website, it gave attention to a swedish television researcher and he invited him live on TV to re-perform the engine noises.
Spread
With the noises of the TV performance, it has been appeared in various file sharing websites renamed to 2TAKTARE.mp3.
The sound has been then adopted to a single serving site called “The Insanity Test” showing a formula one racing car and the rules:
     

1. Turn on the Speakers and allow the page to load fully
 2. Stare at the Picture without laughing for 60 seconds
 3. If you start laughing consider yourself legally insane

In 2003 the swedish animator “Erik Wernquist” created within 6 and 8 weeks a 3D animation using “LightWave”. The animation is called “The Annoying Thing” also the same name to the frog he created. The animation was then posted on “TurboForce3D.com” by him and the animation was download-able as an .avi and an .mpg video file.
The background song is called “In Rock 8 Bit” produced by “Bodenständig 2000”.
In 2004 “Jamba!” used this as a ringtone to show this in a commercial and renamed the audio in “The Crazy Frog”. In an interview with Erik, he expressed his displeasure at the choice of the name by saying, that it isn’t a frog and is not considered to be crazy.
“Axel F” Cover Song
In 2005, the dance music projects “Bass Bumpers” and “Off-Cast Project” created a cover song of Harold Faltermeyer’s “Axel F” and the song was released as a single titled “Crazy Frog – Axel F”, that reached the first place in the british charts.
Then in the same year, the swedish 3D animation company “Kaktus Film” and “Erik Wernquist” made a music video for the song with the title “Axel Frog”.
In December 2005, “Digital Jesters” created a video game for Playstation 2 and PC as a racing game called “Crazy Frog Racer”.
Crazy Frog Brothers
In 2006, two kids created a homemade video, where they lip-synced and danced to the Axel F cover song.
